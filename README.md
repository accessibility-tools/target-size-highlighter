# target size highlighter
A set of bookmarklets to help visualise the size of pointer-input targets on webpages.

These bookmarklets are being released under the MIT licence, to match the licensing of the CSS-inject tool I used.

## Use of the CSS-inject tool
The CSS injector template for these bookmarklets came from the [CSS-inject tool](http://mcdlr.com/css-inject/) created by [DrummerHead](https://github.com/DrummerHead). Learn more on the [CSS-inject GitHub repository](https://github.com/DrummerHead/CSS-inject).

## Cursor bookmarklet acknowledgements
